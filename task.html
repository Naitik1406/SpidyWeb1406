    <h1>NASA unveils why the blood moon lights up the sky in red &#127770;</h1>
  <p> <b> A blood moon is one of the most striking celestial events, captivating skywatchers across the globe. During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface. This alignment transforms the Moon into a fiery red orb, inspiring myths, legends, and awe for centuries. </b></p>
<p><b>According to <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration ">NASA</abbr> , the red colour appears because sunlight passing through Earth's atmosphere is scattered. Shorter blue wavelengths are filtered out, while longer red wavelengths reach the Moon, giving it the characteristic crimson glow. Additional factors, such as atmospheric dust, volcanic activity, or moisture, can intensify the red hue, making each blood moon unique. </b></p>
<p><b> While some cultures have historically linked the blood moon to omens, the science is clear: it is a natural phenomenon resulting from celestial mechanics and atmospheric physics. In this article, we explain why the Moon turns red during a total lunar eclipse, what causes this striking effect, and how observers can safely experience this breathtaking spectacle.</b></p>
